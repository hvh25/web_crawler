# Blogit (beta)

Blogit is a flexible blogging solution for Rails apps. It:

* Is Rack based;
* Is a complete MVC solution based on Rails engines;
* Aims to work right out of the box but remain fully customisable.

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile

``` ruby
gem "blogit"
```

...and run `bundle install` to install the gem.

Next, run:

``` bash
# add an initializer to config/initializers with all of the configuration options
$ rails g blogit:install
# This will add the necessary migrations to your app's db/migrate directory
rake blogit:install:migrations
# This will run any pending migrations
rake db:migrate
``` 
then add the following to your routes.rb file:

``` bash
# config/routes.rb
mount Blogit::Engine => "/blog"
```

... and finally, declare which of your models acts as blogger in your app (usually User).

``` ruby
class User
  
  blogs

end
```  

## Configuration

Running `rails g blogit:install` will add an initializer file named blogit.rb. In here
you can set various configuration options. Please [read the documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/blogit/Blogit/Configuration) for a full list of the options available.

## At no extra cost...

we'll also throw in:

* An XML Sitemap located at `/blog/posts.xml`

* Sitemap submission to the major search engines (via [Pingr](http://github.com/katanacode/pingr "Pingr") - off by default)
